# ML22/23-11 Improve UnitTests for Temporal Memory Algorithm - Azure Cloud Implementation
## Introduction
Temporal memory algorithms have gained popularity as a promising approach for modeling temporal sequences in machine learning. This project aims to improve the unit test for the given temporal memory algorithm, which is based on the principles of the cortical column and the neocortex. The algorithm uses a sparse distributed representation of data and incorporates temporal context to predict future values in a sequence. We implemented improvements to the existing unit test, including the addition of more test cases with varying complexity and the implementation of cross-validation techniques for better evaluation of the algorithm's performance. We also optimized the implementation of the algorithm for improved efficiency and scalability. Moreover, running this project on Azure Cloud, we explored and got to use very useful features of Azure Cloud services.

## How to run the experiment
## Step1 : Message input from azure portal
at a message to queues inside Azure storage account.
p.s Encode the message body in Base64

**How to add message :** 

Azure portal > Home > ccprojectsd | Queues > variableiqueue> Add message

### Queue Message that will trigger the experiment:
~~~json
{
  "ExperimentId": "1",
  "InputFile": "runccproject",
  "Description": "Cloud Computing Implementation",
  "ProjectName": "ML22/23-11. Implement UnitTests on Temporal Memory Algorithm",
  "GroupName": "variabl-i",
  "Students": [ "Syed Mostain Ahmed", "Farjana Akter", "Shamsir Doha" ]
}
~~~
Go to "variable-i-container," "Containers," and "logs" to make sure the experiment is being run from a container instance.
